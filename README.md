## About

PassManager is a user-friendly and intuitive password managing application that runs using JavaFX. This was developed for my IA for Computer Science during Year 12/13.

Primarily coded in Java, this was one of my first projects that used Object-oriented programming.

Some features incliude:
  - Securely log passwords and login information into an offline MySQL database and encrypting sensitive data fields.
  - Manage several user accounts on this application.
  - Minimalistic interface, and settings to customise interface

This was completed in 2021.
